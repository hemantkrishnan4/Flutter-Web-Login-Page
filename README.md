# Flutter Web Login Page

A Flutter project for designing a webpage with registration and login functionality using Firebase as the backend.

## Installation

1. Download the .zip file and extract it to a folder.
2. Navigate to the 'lib' folder.
3. Open the file named 'main.dart' in VSCode.
4. Press 'F5' on Windows to start debugging and run the website locally.
   - Alternatively, click on 'Run' from the Menu bar and then click 'Run and Debug.'

## Firebase Authentication

The project includes an 'auth.html' file with HTML code connected to Firebase. Follow these steps to integrate it into the login page:

1. Go to the 'web' folder.
2. Open the 'index.html' file.
3. Make similar changes as instructed in the 'auth.html' file.

Note: The login button in the Flutter webpage serves for both login and registration. If the user is registered, it will log in; otherwise, it will register and then log in.

PS: Make the necessary changes in the HTML code.
